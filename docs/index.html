<p> Documentation in this page is for ggbio in devel-branch which will be come
  released branch after Oct 3rd. </p>

All the following documentation are reproducible, they are all generatd from
codes by <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> package.
<h2><a href="man">Manual</a></h2>
<p>This manual is basically R help for ggbio, I am using knit to parse all my
  rd files and this will automatically dump htmls for all the manual. This is a
  good complement to the vignette, and especially provide enough detailed usage
  for many components, such as geom, stat, theme, etc. This is a help page with
  graphics! May not be important for other packages, but critical for
  visualization packages like ggbio.</p>

<h2><a href="vignettes">Vignettes</a></h2>
<p>vignette is a better way to make a full tutorial with more case studies and
  illustration, a pdf file will be provided soon and will be shown on
  bioconductor's website.</p>

<h2>Paper</h2>
<p>Provisional PDF is provided at <italic>Genome Biology</italic>
  <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/8/R77/abstract"> here</a>, this is a
  good way to understand the framework we proposed about genomic data
  visualziation and about extended grammar of graphics. Citation is is shown in homepage.</p>
