<p>Thanks for your patience, you may notice that I have removed old
documentations, I have to make it clear about documentation in next release(Oct 3rd). </p>

<p><ul>
  <li>I appologize you may end up with *endless loop* to find documentation,
  which bioconductor pdf vignette point to this website and this website point
  to bioconductor and so on. That's because in released version of ggbio(Bioc
  2.10), we put every documentation in this website, which is hybrid of
  knitr+jekyll+github page. We are going to drop this style, because we document
  everything now in sweave or knitr, and would be part of bioconductor website
  for this package, it's more formal, so basically documentation of bioconductor
  packages will be better hosted on bioc website. Our principle would be keep
  one copy for those things(either source code or documentation) in one place. 
<li> ggplot2 0.9.2 is released on Sep.3rd, this will breaks tracks API in ggbio,
  I am working on solving this issue.
<li> bioconductor 2.11 is going to be released on <b>Oct
  3rd</b>(<a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/developers/release-schedule/">schedule</a>),
  and I will put together all documentation and fixes and updates by then. By
  the time bioconductor is released, all vignettes with codes will be visible
  from bioconductor website. Before that time, I really appreciate your patience
  and attention for this package!
</ul></p>

All the following documentation are reproducible, they are all generatd from
codes by <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> package.
<h2><a href="man">Manual</a></h2>
<p>This manual is basically R help for ggbio, I am using knit to parse all my
  rd files and this will automatically dump htmls for all the manual. This is a
  good complement to the vignette, and especially provide enough detailed usage
  for many components, such as geom, stat, theme, etc. This is a help page with
  graphics! May not be important for other packages, but critical for
  visualization packages like ggbio.</p>

<h2><a href="vignettes">Vignettes</a></h2>
<p>vignette is a better way to make a full tutorial with more case studies and
  illustration, a pdf file will be provided soon and will be shown on
  bioconductor's website.</p>
