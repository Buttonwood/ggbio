		<p id="frontbio"> ggbio: An R implementation for extending the
		Grammar of Graphics for Genomic Data </p>
		
		<p>The ggbio package extends and specializes the grammar of
		graphics for biological data. The graphics are designed to
		answer common scientific questions, in particular those often
		asked of high throughput genomics data. All core Bioconductor
		data structures are supported, where appropriate. The package
		supports detailed views of particular genomic regions, as well
		as genome-wide overviews. Supported overviews include ideograms
		and grand linear views. High-level plots include sequence
		fragment length, edge-linked interval to data view, mismatch
		pileup, and several splicing summaries.</p>
